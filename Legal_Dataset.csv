1,"WWE vs. Savio Fernandes","World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) filed a case alleging copyright infringement and dilution of the trademark. WWE is a company incorporated in USA, having offices in various countries including India. It is an integrated media and entertainment company, mainly featuring professional wrestling. Along with weekly shows and occasional pay-per-views, it offers a variety of consumer products like apparel, posters, action figures, etc. The shows feature many wrestlers, who work on-screen characters with different traits. WWE, being the creator of these characters, holds US copyright registrations of their names, catchphrases and other attributes. Along with this, it also has registrations over the mark ‘WORLD WRESTLING ENTERTAINMENT’ and the WWE Scratch Logo.
FACTS
The defendants are proprietors of a shop and online store, which claim to be selling official WWE merchandise. The plaintiffs came across the defendant’s websites www.wrestlezoneindia.com and www.wrestlezone.co.in, which sell a number of products bearing names and logos belonging to WWE. In fact, they openly called themselves ‘The WWE Merchandise Store’, incorporating the scratch logo. The plaintiff then hired an independent investigator to ascertain the extent of the defendant’s activities. The findings of the independent investigator brought to light the other stores maintained by the defendant. He also bought some goods from the shop. The products were a copy of the authentic products with minor defects. Some had the neck tags torn out, some lacked the registration “®” symbol, and some prints were different.
WWE submitted that it is the creator of the characters, and holds copyright over their depiction. Both the public and the wrestlers themselves recognise these rights. The defendants illegally represented these characters and sold products in their name without WWE’s permission. This was a blatant infringement of the Plaintiff’s copyright rights under the Copyrights Act, 1957. The defendant’s unauthorised use of WWE’s intellectual property disillusioned the consumers. Since WWE characters are immensely popular, selling their merchandise misleads the public into believing that the defendants were associated with WWE. The defendants also used the WWE trademark without permission. They also used the names of WWE talent like John Cena, Rey Mysterio, etc. This is unauthorised use of their trade name and an infringement of registered trademarks. This infringement not only harmed the plaintiff but resulted in unjust enrichment of the defendant. They mislead the public into buying counterfeit goods by using the plaintiff’s reputation. The Plaintiff then pointed out that the defendants claimed to be selling ‘Officially Licensed WWE Merchandise’. This has damaged the plaintiff’s goodwill. The unrestricted use of WWE’s trademark would gradually erode the uniqueness and exclusivity of the trademarks. Therefore, the defendant’s activities need to be curbed immediately.
judgement
Summons and notices were issued to the defendants. However, they failed to respond. Considering this, the court passed a temporary injunction order against them. This restrained the defendants and their partners from selling, displaying, advertising or dealing with WWE’s registered trademarks. Additionally, two Local Commissioners were sent to examine the defendant’s goods. They found that 267 goods were counterfeit, infringing the plaintiff’s trademark. The defendants still failed to show up, while the plaintiff presented evidence to back its claims. The defendant’s non-appearance meant no rebuttals or cross-examinations.
The plaintiffs claimed Rs 10,00,500 as damages for the infringements. They referred to numerous judgements to back this claim. After hearing the proceedings, the court awarded a sum of Rs 5,00,000 to the plaintiff, along with a permanent injunction order against the defendants

2,"K. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961","
 Brief facts:
Appellant, Kawas Manekshaw Nanavati , a commander in the Indian Navy was charged for murder of deceased Prem Ahuja under section 302 and 304, part 1 of IPC. When the appellant was away for his work, his wife, Sylvia, nurtured an illicit relationship with Mr. Ahuja, a friend of Nanavati.
On 27th April 1959 , Nanavati returned from one of his long voyages. When he came home, his wife seemed to be behaving strangely and was not responsive or affectionate to him. Sensing something, he asked, to which Sylvia confessed about her affair with Ahuja. That evening, Nanavati dropped Sylvia (wife) and their two children at a cinema hall and went to confront Ahuja. He first went to his ship, collected his pistol on a false pretext from the stores along with six bullets, completed his official duties and continued for Prem Ahuja’s office. On not finding him there, he made his way to Ahuja’s home where he found Ahuja. There was a verbal confrontation between the two men. After the confrontation, there was an altercation after which three shots were fired and Prem Ahuja dropped dead. Nanavati headed straight to confess to the Provost Marshal of the Western Naval Command and later turned himself over to the Deputy Commissioner of Police.
The jury found him not guilty of murder which did not find favour with the Sessions Judge and he referred the case to Bombay High Court. The Bombay High Court dismissed the Jury’s decision and convicted Nanavati under section 302 and 304 Part 1 of IPC.
Nanavati filed an appeal before the Supreme Court.
Issue:
The issue of the case was whether Nanavati shot Ahuja in the “heat of the moment” or whether it was a premeditated murder which will determine the conviction of Nanavati.
Argument of the respondent:
The first contention that was raised was that Ahuja had just come out of the shower wearing towel. When his body was discovered, his towel was still intact on his body. It had neither loosened nor fallen off which was highly improbable in case of a scuffle. Moreover, after Sylvia’s confession, a calm and collected Nanavati took them to a movie hall, dropped them there and then went to his shop to retrieve his pistol, that too under a false pretext. This shows he had enough cooling time and provocation was neither grave nor sudden and that Nanavati had planned the murder. Moreover, according to the testimony of Ahuja’s servant, Anjani, who was present at the house during the occurrence of the incident and so, was a natural witness, testified that there were four shots consecutively in quick succession and the entire event occurred in less than a minute thereby ruling out scuffle. Nanavati walked out of Ahuja’s residence, without explaining to his sister Mamie, who was present in another room of the flat that it was an accident. The deputy commissioner of police testified that Nanavati confessed that he had shot dead Ahuja and even corrected the misspelling of his name in the police record thereby showing Nanavati was not dazed.
Judgement:
The Supreme Court upheld that this was a clear case of premeditated murder and concurred with the decision of the High Court and sentenced him to life imprisonment for culpable homicide amounting to murder.

3,Amardeep Singh vs. Harveen Kaur,"Amardeep Singh vs. Harveen Kaur
FACTS:
The marriage of the Appellant and the Respondent took place on 16th January 1994 at Delhi. Two children were born from the wedlock in 1995 and 2003 respectively. Some disputes arose between the parties and thereafter both the parties started living separately in 2008. On 28th April 2017, a settlement was arrived between the parties to resolve all the disputes and seek divorce by mutual consent. The Respondent’s wife is to be given permanent alimony of Rs.2.75 crores. The Appellant husband handed over two cheques of Rs.50,00,000/-, which have been duly honored, towards part payment of permanent alimony. The custody of the children is to be with the Appellant. Accordingly, a Civil Suit was filed before the Family Court (West), Tis Hazari Court, New Delhi, and on 8th May 2017, and statements of the parties were recorded. The parties have sought a waiver of the period of six months for the second motion on the ground that they have been living separately for the last more than eight years and there is no possibility of their reunion. Any delay will affect the chances of their resettlement. The parties have moved to the Supreme Court on the ground that only Supreme Court can relax the six months as per previous decisions of this Court.
ISSUES:
Whether the statutory period prescribed under Section 13-B(1) of the Act is mandatory or directory and if a directory, whether could be dispensed with even by the High Court in the exercise of its writ/appellate jurisdiction?
Whether the minimum period of six months stipulated under Section 13B(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (the Act) for a motion for passing a decree of divorce based on mutual consent is mandatory or can be relaxed in any exceptional situations?
How long they have been staying apart?
Are there any other proceedings between the parties?
Have the parties attended mediation/conciliation?
Have the parties arrived at a genuine settlement which takes care of alimony, custody of a child, or any other pending issues between the parties?
DIRECTION BY THE SUPREME COURT:  
The question which came up for consideration before the Hon’ble Supreme Court was whether the exercise of power under Article 142 of the Constitution to waive the period under Section 13B(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act was mandatory or directory. While determining this point the Hon’ble Supreme Court referred the decision in the case of Manish Goel vs. Rohini Goel, wherein the Bench of two Hon’ble Judges of this Court held that the jurisdiction of this court under Article 142 could not be used to waive the statutory period of six months for the second motion under Section 13B, as doing so will be passing an order in contravention of a statutory provision.
The court further held that “after considering the above decisions, we are of the view that since Manish Goel (supra) holds the field, in absence of contrary decisions by a larger Bench, power under Article 142 of the Constitution cannot be exercised contrary to the statutory provisions, especially when no proceedings are pending before this Court and this Court is approached only for waiver of the statute.”
In this regard, the Hon’ble Court held that in determining the question of whether the provision is mandatory or directory, language alone is not always decisive. The Court was of the view that where the Court dealing with a matter is satisfied that a case is made out to waive the statutory period under Section 13B(2), it can do so after considering the following :
The statutory period of six months specified in Section 13B(2), in addition to the statutory period of one year under Section 13B(1) of separation of parties is already over before the first motion itself;
All efforts for mediation/conciliation including efforts in terms of Order XXXIIA Rule 3 CPC/Section 23(2) of the Act/Section 9 of the Family Courts Act to reunite the parties have failed and there is no likelihood of success in that direction by any further efforts;
The parties have genuinely settled their differences including alimony, custody of a child or any other pending issues between the parties;
The waiting period will only prolong their agony;
The waiver application can be filed one week after the first motion giving reasons for the prayer for waiver.
If the above conditions are satisfied, the waiver of the waiting period for the second motion will be at the discretion of the Court.
Since we are of the view that the period mentioned in Section 13B(2) is not mandatory but directory, it will be open to the Court to exercise its discretion in the facts and circumstances of each case where there is no possibility of parties resuming cohabitation and there are chances of alternative rehabilitation.
Needless to say that in conducting such proceedings the Court can also use the medium of video conferencing and also permit genuine representation of the parties through close relations such as parents or siblings where the parties are unable to appear in person for any just and valid reason as may satisfy the Court, to advance the interest of justice.
The parties are now at liberty to move the concerned court for fresh consideration in the light of this order.",https://indiankanoon.org/doc/79830357/
4,Novartis AG Vs Union of India,"“Novartis AG Vs Union of India” is landmark Judgement in world of Intellectual Property Rights delivered by two-Judge bench of Supreme Court of India consisting of Justice Aftab Alam and Justice Ranjana Prakash Desai. While rendering a Judgement each socio-legal aspect was examined, including the Indian Patent and Designs Law of 1911, the conditions of the Indian pharmaceutical industry between 1952 and 2004, the Patent Law of 1970, the TRIPS Agreement, Doha Declaration, 2001 and the Patent Law 2005 (amendment).
Background
Zimmermann invented a number  of  derivatives  of  N-phenyl-2pyrimidine-amine, one of which is ’Imatinib’. These derivatives,  including  Imatinib,  are  capable  of inhibiting certain protein kinases, especially protein  kinase  C  and  PDGF receptor  tyrosine  kinase  and  thus  have valuable anti-tumour properties and  can  be  used  in  the  preparation  of pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of warm-blooded  animals.
The appellant filed the application for the granting of a patent for Imatinib Mesylate in crystalline beta form to the Chennai Patent Office claiming that the invented product, the beta crystal form of Imatinib Mesylate (Glivec). He further asserted that the aforementioned properties make the invented product ""new"" (and superior). However, at that time, India did not grant patents to pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. The appellant’s application lay dormant under  an  arrangement  called  ""the mailbox procedure"". Another application on March 27, 2002, for grant  of  exclusive  marketing  rights (EMR) for the subject product under section 24A of the  Act.  
Novartis AG has filed SLP in Honourable Supreme Court under Article 136 of the constitution.
Analysis
The major question in front of Supreme Court were:
What is the true import of section 3(d) of the Patents  Act,  1970? How does it interplay with clauses (j) and (ja) of section  2(1)?
Does  the product for which the appellant claims patent qualify  as  a  ""new  product"" as invention  that  has  a  feature  that  involves technical advance over the existing knowledge and that makes  the  invention ""not obvious"" to a person skilled in  the  art?
In  case  the  appellant’s product satisfies the tests and thus qualifies  as  ""invention""  within  the meaning of clauses (j) and (ja)  of  section  2(1),  can  its  patentability still be questioned and denied on the ground that section 3(d) puts  it  out of the category of ""invention""?
After answering above questions, it depends, whether the appellant is entitled to obtain the patent for the crystalline beta form of a chemical compound called Imatinib Mesylate.
While answering the above questions hon’ble Supreme Court held that: 
Section 3(d) as  representing  ""Patentability"", a concept distinct and separate from  ""invention"".  But  if  clause  (d)  is isolated from the rest of section 3, and the legislative history behind  the incorporation of Chapter II in the Patents act, 1970, is  disregarded,  then it is possible to see section 3(d) as an  extension  of  the  definition  of ""invention"" and to link section 3(d) with clauses (j) and  (ja)  of  section 2(1). In that case, on reading clauses (j) and (ja)  of  section  2(1)  with section 3(d) it would appear that  the  Act  sets  different  standards  for qualifying as ""inventions"" things belonging to different  classes,  and  for medicines and  drugs  and  other  chemical  substances,  the  Act  sets  the invention threshold further higher, by virtue  of  the  amendments  made  in section 3(d) in the year 2005.
Court find no force in the submission  that  the  development  of Imatinib Mesylate  from  Imatinib  is  outside  the  Zimmermann  patent  and constitutes an invention as understood in the law of patent in India.
Court reject  the appellant’s case that Imatinib Mesylate is a new product and the outcome  of an invention beyond the Zimmermann patent. The consequential  finding,  therefore,  is  that  Imatinib  Mesylate  does  not qualify the test of ""invention"" as laid down in section 2(1)(j) and  section 2(1)(ja) of the Patents Act, 1970.
Court held that the subject product, the  beta  crystalline  form of Imatinib Mesylate, does not qualify the test of Section 3(d) of  the  Act but that is not to say that Section 3(d)  bars  patent  protection  for  all incremental inventions of chemical and pharmaceutical  substances.  It was also stated by hon’ble Court that “It  will be a grave mistake to read this judgment  to  mean  that  section  3(d)  was amended with the intent to  undo  the  fundamental  change  brought  in  the patent regime by deletion of section 5 from the  Parent  Act.  That  is  not said in this judgment”",https://indiankanoon.org/doc/165776436/
5,(Labour laws) PUDR v U0I,"Facts of the case
There was a complaint of the violation of Article 24 of the Constitution of India on behalf of child labourers employed in construction work in Delhi. Also, there were labourers who worked on the ASIAD-82 sites both on stadia and the infrastructure like flyovers and hotels. They were recruited by agents of construction contractors from backward village of Orissa, Bihar, W.B., Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan. 
These workers were forced to complete the ASIAD projects in time by November 19 and they were working at a feverish place which were often far beyond. The working hours fixed by laws without the minimum daily wages due to the living in hovels and their children were dying of malnutrition and they themselves frequently became victims of accidents. 
Such dreadful working and living conditions to which these workers were subjected to, was brought to public notice by a fact-finding team of the PUDR i.e. the People’s Union for Democratic Rights. The PUDR visited some of the major sites in July and August 1981 and interviewed the workers as well as their employers, following this up, the PUDR filed a writ petition before the Supreme Court on November 16,1981. 
By way of the PIL, it requested to issue observance of the provisions of various labour laws in relation to the workers employed in the construction work of the ASIAD-82 projects. Admitting the writ petition on May, 1982, it was directed by P.N. Bhagwati, J and Baharul Islam, J, that the Union Government, the Delhi Development Authority and the Delhi Administration that the three concerns which had appointed the contractors for the ASIAD construction work should ensure the payment of minimum wages and provision of other facilities to the workers under the various laws.
Further, three ombudsmen were also appointed by the judges, which happened for the first time in the history of judicial history of India. It was ordered for protecting the interest of the workers and to ensure the observance of the laws. They were also requested to visit the major sites of the construction work and submit weekly reports to the Hon’ble Supreme Court relating to cases of violation of the laws. 
Issues raised
Firstly, whether the writ petition can be maintainable against the private individual under Article-32 of the Constitution of India?
Secondly, whether Article-21 of the Constitution of India also include right to live with human dignity and right to livelihood?
Judgement of the Hon’ble Court
It was held by the Hon’ble Court that the right of a poor worker to directly approach the Supreme Court under Article 32of the Constitution of India for the enforcement of rights created under various labour laws and particularly under the provisions of Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970, Interstate Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1977, Equal Remuneration Act, 1976, Employment of Children Act, 1970 and Minimum Wages Act, 1948 is correct. 
 Thence, the scope of the meaning of article 21 of the Constitution (right to life) to include the right to livelihood along with the ‘right to live with basic human dignity’ was extended by the Hon’ble Supreme Court. 
Also, a wider meaning has been given to the provisions of Article 21, 17, 23 of the Constitution of India, so as to cover the cases of Non-payment or less payment of wages to the workers which they are entitled under the relevant provisions of law. The Court further held that the scope of Article 23 is wide and unlimited and strikes at “traffic in human beings” and “beggar and other forms of forced labour” wherever they institute. 
It is not merely “beggar” which is prohibited by Article 23 but also all other forms of forced labour as it is violative of human dignity and contrary to basic human values. And therefore, strikes to violate Article 21 also. The court had declared solemn constitutional responsibility of the government and its agencies to make sure that various laws are properly implemented. It must be made sure that such laws are not only implemented by it but also by private persons or non-governmental establishments. The Supreme Court used expressions “bonded labour” and “forced labour” in Article 21 to “right to live with human dignity” and such rights and benefits guaranteed to the labourers under various labour laws. These were made parts of basic Human Dignity and raised to the status of Fundamental Rights.",https://indiankanoon.org/doc/496663/
6,Navtej Singh Johar vs Union Of India Ministry Of Law,"Facts:
A written petition was filed by on 26th April 2016 by Navtej Singh Johar, a dancer from the LGBT community along with 4 others to challenge the constitutional validity of Section 377 of IPC which criminalizes consensual sexual intercourse between same-sex adults in private. In the prayer, the petitioners prayed for declaration of “right to sexuality”, “right to sexual autonomy” and “right to choice of a sexual partner” to be a part of right to life guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution of India. It was also prayed by the petitioners to declare Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code as unconstitutional.
Issues:
(1) Whether Section 377 of IPC violates Right to Equality under Article 14 of the Constitution?
(2) Whether Section 377 of IPC violates Freedom of Speech and Expression under Article 19 of the Constitution?
(3) Whether Section 377 of IPC violates Right to Life with dignity under Article 21 of the Constitution?
(4) Whether discrimination based on sexual orientation under Section 377 of IPC violates Article 15 of the Constitution?
Judgment:
The bench found that Section 377 discriminates against individuals based on their sexual orientation and/or gender identity, violating Article 14 and 15 of the Constitution. Further, they ruled that Section 377 violates the rights to life, dignity, and autonomy of personal choice under Article 21. Finally, they found that it inhibits an LGBT individual’s ability to fully realize their identity, by violating the right to freedom of expression under Article 19(1)(a). They all referred to Court’s recent judgments in NALSA v Union of India (recognized transgender identity) and Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v Union of India (recognized fundamental right to privacy).
The court held that If one person prefers sex with the same gender it is their choice and if such sexual involvement is consensual and does not harm the other then invasion into these matters will be a breach of privacy and therefore a violation of Article-21. The court referred to Article 12 of Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 17 of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. Right to live with dignity is another right recognised under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution and section-377 denies such right by criminalising the identity of a person based on his or her sexuality. Homosexuals and transgenders constitute a considerable section of the society which is denounced by section-377. The LGBT community is forced to live according to society and is exposed to harassment, exploitation, cruelty and humiliation. Several countries including the US, England, Australia and Canada have decriminalized consensual sodomy and unnatural acts.  The Law Commission in its 142nd report has also expressed its desire for the deletion of  section-377. According to their report, section-377 was meant to criminalize non-consensual sex and child abuse but now after the insertion and amendment of sections-375 to section-376E in IPC, there is no need for section-377. Section-377 also targets a particular community i.e. LGBT and discriminates them on the basis of their gender and sexual identity which is unreasonable and unfair and is therefore violative of  Article 14 of the Indian Constitution.The court also decided that sexual orientation is a ground parallel to sex and Article 15(2) of the Indian Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The court declared section-377 as unconstitutional as it violates Articles 21, 14 and 15 of our Constitution. Moreover, section-377 will continue in cases of non-consensual penile non-vaginal sex and penile non-vaginal sex which involves minors i.e. a person below 18 years of age.
Thus, the five-judge bench of the Indian Supreme Court (Court) unanimously held that Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, insofar as it applied to consensual sexual conduct between adults in private, was unconstitutional.

7,Case Note on Re: Berubari Union case (1960) 3 SCR 250,"Case Note on Re: Berubari Union case (1960) 3 SCR 250

Akash Garg UIL, Ludhiana Page 1
Facts: On June 30, 1947, the Governor General announced that it had been decided to divide the provinces of
Bengal and Punjab. As a result, a boundary commission was setup and Sir Cyril Radcliffe was appointed as
president. Radcliffe had divided the Jalpaigudi district between India and Pakistan by assigning thanas to one
country and others to another country. The boundary line was determined on the limits of the thanas. In describing
this border, Radcliffe omitted to mention a Thana. Union Berubari No. 12 is in the town of Jalpaigudi thana and
has been awarded to India. However, the omission of Thana Boda and the misrepresentation on the map allowed
Pakistan to claim that part of Berubari belonged to it. The commission then held its inquiry and issued an award
on August 12, 1947. Subsequently, certain border disputes broke out between India and Pakistan and it was agreed
between them at the Inter-Dominion Conference held in New Delhi on December 14, 1948, that a court should be
set up. But on this occasion no problem was raised about the Union of Berubari. It was two years later that the
question of the union of Berubari was raised by the government of Pakistan for the first time in 1952. Throughout
this period, the Union of Berubari remained in the possession of the Union Indian and was governed as part of
West Bengal. It was in these circumstances that this agreement was concluded between the two prime ministers
on September 10, 1958 stipulating that the Berubari Union No. 12 will be divided so as to give half the area in

Pakistan, the other half adjacent to India being kept by India. . It also included the exchange of the former Cooch-
Behar enclaves in Pakistan and the Pakistani enclaves in India without claiming compensation for an additional

area going to Pakistan. Doubt arose as to the implementation of the Agreement, which is why the President
considered that the questions of law which arose were of such a nature and of such importance that it was expedient
that the opinion of the Supreme Court of India be obtained on this subject; and thus, in the exercise of the powers
conferred on it by clause (1) of art. 143 of the Constitution. The matter was heard by Seven-judge Bench of
Supreme Court.
Question of Law:
(1) Is any legislative action necessary for the implementation of the Agreement relating to Berubari Union ?
(2) If so, whether law of Parliament relatable to article 3 of the Constitution sufficient for the purpose or is an
amendment of the Constitution in accordance with article 368 of the Constitution necessary, in addition or in the
alternative ?
(3) Whether law of Parliament relatable to article 3 of the Constitution sufficient for implementation of the
agreement relating to Exchange of Enclaves or is an amendment of the Constitution in accordance with article
368 of the Constitution necessary for the purpose, in addition or in the alternative ?
Rationale: Attorney-General has contended that no legislative action is necessary for the implementation of the
Agreement relating to Berubari Union as well as the exchange of enclaves. He stated the award has already been
given and the agreement is entered to resolve dispute in light of the directions given by the award and in the light
of the maps attached to it. But Court stated, “There is no trace in the Agreement of any attempt to interpret the
award or to determine what the award really meant. The Agreement begins with the statement of the decision that
the area in dispute will be so divided as to give half the area to Pakistan, the other half adjacent to India being
retained by India.”
Held: With regard to above issues court held that:
Yes, legislative action is necessary for the implementation of this Agreement.
And while answering issue 2 and 3 court held that “Article 3 of the Constitution would be incompetent and in the
widest interpretation of Article 3(c) it would be difficult to accept the argument that it covers a case of cession of
a part of national territory in favour of a foreign State. That’s why, law of Parliament relatable to Art. 368 of the
Constitution is competent and necessary. A law of Parliament relatable to both Art. 368 and Art. 3 would be
necessary only if Parliament chooses first to pass a law amending Art. 3 as indicated above; in that case parliament
may have to pass a law on those lines under Art. 368 and then follow it up with a law relatable to the amended
Art. 3 to implement the agreement.”
In this case, it was also held that Constitution is the key to open the mind of the makers but it is not the part of the
constitution relying upon Willoughby’s observed about the preamble to the American Constitution.",https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1120103/
8,"Shayara Bano v. Union of India","Shayara Bano was married to Rizwan Ahmed for 15 years. In 2016, he divorced her through instantaneous triple talaq (talaq -e biddat). She filed a Writ Petition in the Supreme Court asking it to hold three practices – talaq-e-biddat, polygamy, nikah-halala – unconstitutional as they violate Articles 14, 15, 21, 25 of the Constitution.
Talaq-e- bidat is a practise which gives a man the right to divorce his wife by uttering ‘talaq’ three times in one sitting without his wife’s consent. Nikah Halala is a practise where a divorced woman who wants to remarry her husband would have to marry and obtain a divorce, from a second husband before she can go back to her first husband. And polygamy is a practice which allows Muslim men to have more than one wife.
On 16th February 2017, the Court asked Shayara Bano, the Union of India, various women’ rights bodies, and the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) to give written submissions on the issue of talaq-e- bidat, nikah-halala and polygamy. The Union of India and the women rights organizations like Bebaak Collective and Bhartiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA) supported Ms Bano's plea that these practices are unconstitutional. The AIMPLB has argued that uncodified Muslim personal law is not subject to constitutional judicial review and that these are essential practices of the Islamic religion and protected under Article 25 of the Constitution.
After accepting Shayara Bano’s petition, the Apex Court formed a 5-judge constitutional bench on 30th March 2017. The first hearing was on 11th May 2017. 
Issues
1. Whether the practice of talaq-e-bidat (specifically - instantaneous triple talaq) an essential practice of Islam?
2. Whether the practice of Triple Talaq violates any fundamental right.
HELD
On 22nd August 2017, the 5 Judge Bench pronounced its decision in the Triple Talaq Case, declaring that the practise was unconstitutional by a 3:2 majority.

9,Machhi Singh And Others vs State Of Punjab,"Facts of the case 
A dispute between two families resulted in 17 deaths in a series of five incidents that occurred in rapid succession in five different villages, including men, women and children linked to an Amar Singh and his sister Piaro Bai. In this regard, a Machhi Singh and his eleven companions, close relatives and associates were prosecuted in five sessions cases, each relating to the village in which the murders took place. Machi Singh was the ordinary accused at every trial.
Issue involved 
What normal guidelines should be followed to identify the "" rarest of rare cases "" formula for imposing the death penalty?
Principles involved
It was observed by the court that the community as a whole can approve the death penalty when its collective conscience is so shocked that it expects the judiciary to give the death penalty regardless of their personal opinions. Thus, the Court framed guidelines mentioning:
Manner of Commission of Murder: 
When the murder is committed in an extremely brutal, grotesque, diabolical. revolting, or in a despicable way in order to arouse the intense and extreme indignation of the community. For instance: 
When the house of the victim is set aflame with the end in view to roast him alive in the house.
When the victim is subjected to inhuman acts of torture or cruelty in order to bring about his or her death.

Decision of the Court 
The circumstances of the case do reveal that it was a cold- blooded murder and the victims were helpless and undefended. The offence committed was of an exceptionally depraved and heinous character. Accordingly, the death sentence was confirmed. Benefit of reasonable doubt was given to Mohinder Singh as there was lacuna in the evidence that he was in possession of the rifle. Case of Machi Singh formulated this principle into five definite categories and in doing so also considerably enlarged the scope for imposing death penalty. ",https://indiankanoon.org/doc/545301/
